## Background

Why-Phi heavily focuses on streamlining the initial application process for rushees, as well as brothers who are reviewing the applications. However, it currently lacks the same support for the interview process. Instead of relying on Why-Phi, brothers have to utilize Google Forms and keep track of them during interview weekend. After the interview, arbiters will have to painstakingly go through all of the results and manually create slides for each rushee. This entire process creates multiple pain points for brothers.

## Purpose

This feature serves to address and eliminate the pain points that brothers have during the initial screening board, where they review all the interviews. With this feature, brothers will be able to:

- view all of the interview results directly on Why-Phi
- easily navigate between application responses and interview results for a rushee

## What does this feature entail?

1. An Interview Portal
   a. ‘Create Interview’ button: Recruitment team will use this to create interview forms every semester
   b. Interview Form Listings for the current semester: All brothers will use this to fill out interview forms for each rushee
2. Display interviews on applicant card
   a. This way, brothers will be able to see an applicant’s interview results directly on their card, along with all their application information
3. Add mutable status to applicants: ‘no interview’ versus ‘interviewing’

## Future Goals

- Adopt this tracking feature throughout the rest of the pledging process, so that brothers can easily access the pledges’ information
- Arbiters can assign demerits/warnings to each pledge
