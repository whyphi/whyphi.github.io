This guide walks you through installing Python and Pipenv, configuring AWS credentials, and setting up Supabase locally with Docker.

## Python (and Pipenv)

Zap is built using **Python 3.9**. Ensure it's installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

To manage dependencies, we use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), a virtual environment tool.

Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pipenv --version
```

---

## AWS CLI & Credentials

Zap uses multiple AWS services. Before interacting with them:

1. [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. Configure AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Ask a member of the PCT Tech Team for the credentials.

{{% details title="How to confirm your AWS credentials" closed="true" %}}

Run the following:

```bash
cat ~/.aws/credentials
```

Verify that the access keys match the IAM console on [AWS](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials). Or simply confirm with the PCT Tech Team member who gave you them.

**Do not share your credentials with anyone.**

Example config:

```
AWS Access Key ID [****************]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
AWS Secret Access Key [****************]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east-1
Default output format [json]: json
```

## Supabase

As of `dev/v4.0`, Zap uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for its database, replacing DynamoDB and MongoDB. Youâ€™ll run a local Supabase stack using Docker.

{{% steps %}}

### Docker Desktop and Supabase CLI

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- Install [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development#install-the-cli)

**Important:** Do _not_ run `supabase init`. Supabase is already initialized in the `zap` repo.

### Navigate to the `zap` directory

```bash
cd zap
```

### Start the Supabase local stack

```bash
supabase start
```

If successful, youâ€™ll see URLs and keys printed to your terminal:

```
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
     GraphQL URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/graphql/v1
  S3 Storage URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/storage/v1/s3
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
      JWT secret: ...
        anon key: ...
service_role key: ...
```
### Create `.env.local`:

Copy your `API URL` and `anon key` from above into the following file.

```env
# zap/.env.local
SUPABASE_URL=<API URL>
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon key>
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This file must NOT be committed to source control.
{{< /callout >}}

### Stop Supabase

When you are done using the backend, be sure to stop Supabase.

```bash
supabase stop
```

{{% details title="Do I really need to run `supabase stop`?" closed="true" %}}

Technically, you can quit Docker Desktop directly to stop the services, but running `supabase stop` is safer to avoid corruption or orphaned containers.

Just make sure to **fully quit** Docker Desktop or your CPU will want to kill you ðŸ˜¡.

5. Copy your `API URL` and `anon key` and create a `.env.local` file inside the `zap` directory:

```env
# zap/.env.local
SUPABASE_URL=<API URL>
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon key>
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This file must NOT be committed to source control.
{{< /callout >}}

6. When you're done, shut down the local Supabase services:

```bash
supabase stop
```
