## Create and Manage Migrations

Zap uses **Supabase [Declarative Migrations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/declarative-database-schemas)** to version-control schema changes. To keep our environments consistent and stable:

{{< callout  >}}
âœ… All migrations must be created and tested **locally only**.  
ðŸš« Never push manual changes directly to the staging or production databases.
{{< /callout >}}

Our CI/CD pipeline applies migrations to staging or production **only when your branch is merged into `staging` or `main`**, respectively.

### Folder Structure

We use a **declarative schema model**, where schema files live under `zap/supabase/schemas/` and migration files are auto-generated via diffs:

```bash
zap/supabase/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users.sql
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ listings.sql
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 20250608141500_add_users_table.sql
â””â”€â”€ seed.sql
```

### How to Create a Migration

1. **Stop the local Supabase instance:**

```bash
supabase stop
```

2. **Make schema changes**  
   Edit or add `.sql` files inside the `supabase/schemas/` folder. For example:

```sql
-- supabase/schemas/listings.sql
create table "listings" (
  "id" uuid primary key,
  "title" text not null,
  "created_at" timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

3. **Generate a migration by diffing against the current DB state:**

```bash
supabase db diff -f <migration_name>
```

This will create a file like:

```bash
supabase/migrations/20250608141500_add_listings_table.sql
```

4. **Verify the migration**  
   Review the generated SQL for unintended changes. The `db diff` command is smart, but not perfect â€” always inspect!

5. **Test the migration locally**

```bash
supabase db reset
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This will destroy your local data and reapply all migrations.
{{< /callout >}}

6. **Commit your schema and migration files**

```bash
git add supabase/schemas/*.sql supabase/migrations/*.sql
git commit -m "feat(migrations): add listings table"
```

Once merged into `staging` or `main`, GitHub Actions will apply these changes to the appropriate Supabase project.

### Optional: Seeding Data

If you want to provide seed data for development:

- Edit the `supabase/seed.sql` file.
- This script runs after all migrations during local resets.

Keep seed data lightweight and relevant to development testing.

### Pro Tips

- Always **append columns to the end** of tables to avoid noisy diffs.
- Use the `config.toml` to control schema ordering if there are dependencies between tables.

```toml
# supabase/config.toml
[db.migrations]
schema_paths = [
  "./schemas/users.sql",
  "./schemas/*.sql"
]
```
